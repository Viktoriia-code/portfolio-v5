          Before diving into software development, in 2015 I completed my bachelor degree in management and after that I worked for three years as an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) specialist in a major IT company that provides a vast variety of EDI and SaaS solutions for business. I got a deep understanding of B2B EDI and business processes, learned to efficiently organize work processes in IT, and learned to communicate with clients and partners.

          Last autumn I completed a vocational degree in Information Technology at Keuda vocational school in Kerava and I got 6 months of experience working as a frontend developer. In terms of my tech skills, I have solid skills on web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and TypeScript, as well as desktop application development using C# and Python. When I worked as a frontend developer, I focused on creating and testing frontend side of web interfaces, project documentation writing and collaboration with different teams remotely.
